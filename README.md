Introduction :

The main objective of the BWorks Material Donation Tracking web application is to simplify and automate the management of bicycle donations and deliveries for BWorks, a community organization dedicated to bicycle programs. The application's primary focus is to offer a convenient and easy-to-use platform for providers to register, submit donation information, track the progress of deliveries, and generate comprehensive reports.
